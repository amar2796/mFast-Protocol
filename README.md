# Generating C++ classes from FAST XML specification files
mFAST provides two approaches to incorporate FAST template specification into applications. The first (and preferred) approach is using the tool fast_type_gen to generate C++ types for corresponding FAST templates. Using the generated C++ types makes it easier to read/write application code and provides stronger type safety. It also eliminates the need to parse the XML specification at runtime and thus reduce application memory footprint. The fast_type_gen tool is located under the $MFAST_BUILD_DIR/bin directory. At current stage, it only takes FAST XML files as its arguments and generating C++ files without any options like the following.

$MFAST_BUILD_DIR/bin/fast_type_gen test1.xml test2.xml
For each XML specification file, fast_type_gen will generate three files (.h, .inl and .cpp) with the base name of those generated files and the same with their corresponding xml file. The C++ namespace of the generated C++ classes are also the same with the base filename. Currently, There is no other way to change the namespace unless you change the filename of the input XML file or directly modify the generated code.

If your input XML specification files have dependencies among them, all input files must be generated at once; i.e. you cannot do something like fast_type_gen input1.xml and then fast_type_gen input2.xml if input2.xml is dependent on input1.xml. An input FAST specification file A is only dependent on another file B if and only if B contains a static templateRef where the name of templateRef is only defined in A. In addition, fast_type_gen cannot handle circular dependency between its input files.

To encode/decode FAST messages correctly, each FAST template must have a unique template identifier. The specification does not define how to map template names to template identifiers. In our implementation, we choose to use the number specified by the id attribute in the template definition, as the template identifier for encoder/decoder purposes. Furthermore, even though FAST specification does not have any restriction on what the id attributes for fields can be, fast_type_gen can generate valid C++ code only when the value for id attributes are unsigned 32 bits integers.

There are some limitations in the current implementation of mFAST. For one, fast_type_gen is not robust enough to report syntactic or semantic errors from its input files. It's possible that the code generation process can succeed and yet the generated code won't compile or even executed correctly if errors exist in its input files. For example, if the names of templates or fields are not valid C++ identifiers, the generated code would not compile. This is an issue to be addressed in the future release of this product.

Another approach to use a template specification is to explicitly read the XML file in the application; however, this approach loses type safety and the XML parser would increase the application memory footprint. We will further discuss the API for this approach later.







# FAST Template to mFAST C++ Type Mapping
In order to maximize the space efficiency of deserialized FAST messages while providing a user friendly API, mFAST employs a very unique mapping of FAST templates to C++ types. Unlike OMG IDL/C++ type mapping or Google Protocol Buffers, where each message type is represented by a C++ struct/class and the struct/class is responsible for resource management as well as providing getter/setter functions for accessing field values; mFAST separates those roles into different C++ classes. For the previous mentioned example /*FAST template MDRefreshSample, three C++ classes named MDRefreshSample, MDRefreshSample_cref and MDRefreshSample_mref are generated by fast_type_gen. Based on their functionalities, we name them as **value holder**, **constant reference** and **mutable reference** classes respectively.*/

**A value holder class manages the internal resources needed by fields of a message, it does not provide getters/setters to read or write its contained fields. The member functions it provides only allows you to construct/copy the value or to create the reference objects. Suppose the previous mentioned FAST templates XML is saved as 'example.xml', the generated MDRefreshSample would be as follows.**

# ðŸ§¾ Example: Generated C++ Header from `example.xml`

The following C++ code is generated by `fast_type_gen` from `example.xml`:

```cpp
// example.h, generated from fast_type_gen example.xml
namespace example {

class MDRefreshSample_cref : public mfast::message_cref {
  // ...
};

class MDRefreshSample_mref : public MDRefreshSample_cref {
  // ...
};

class MDRefreshSample
  : private boost::array<mfast::value_storage, 6>,
    public mfast::message_type
{
public:
  enum {
    the_id = 10001
  };

  MDRefreshSample(
    mfast::allocator* alloc = mfast::malloc_allocator::instance());

  MDRefreshSample(
    const MDRefreshSample_cref& other,
    mfast::allocator* alloc = mfast::malloc_allocator::instance());

  MDRefreshSample_cref ref() const;
  MDRefreshSample_cref cref() const;
  MDRefreshSample_mref ref();
  MDRefreshSample_mref mref();

private:
  MDRefreshSample(const MDRefreshSample&);
  MDRefreshSample& operator=(const MDRefreshSample&);
};

mfast::templates_description* description();

} // namespace example
```

**Constant and mutable reference objects, on the other hand, are used for reading/writing field values, testing the presence of a field, and querying field meta data. Each type in FAST specification, whether primitive or not, has its own representative constant/mutable reference classes. The following figure is the UML representation for the basic constant reference classes.**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0827010a-ec9a-4e6a-a225-bbb3beeb3379)


Figure 1. mFAST constant reference class hierarchy

At the center of figure is the field_cref class, which is the base for all those constant reference classes can be directly used to refer fields. It provides present() for testing the presence of the value and other functions to query meta data such as name(), id(), or field_type().

The classes to the left of field_cref represent the references for the FAST primitive types. All references classes for numeric types provides a value() member function. The references classes for string and vector types provides interfaces like the const member function of std::string and std::vector<T> respectively.

group_cref and sequence_cref, representing group and sequence types in FAST, provides access to the nested fields or elements respectively. The sequenece_element_cref class is used to represent the elements in a sequence. It does not inherit from field_cref because it does not correspond to a field in FAST sense. The class nested_message_cref, on the other hand, represents templateRef in FAST. The class message_cref, corresponding to template in FAST, is the base class for topmost level application types. The class aggregate_cref provides an abstraction to represent a collection of fields regardless whether the containing type is a group, a message or a element in a sequence.

In the MDRefreshSample example, to read the contained fields, we need to use cref() to obtain anMDRefreshSample_cref object. The generated MDRefreshSample_cref class has a set of get_xxx() member functions, where xxx is the field names, used for reading a field value. Likewise, a set of set_xxx() member functions is generated for writing field values in MDRefreshSample_mref. All getter/setter member functions return constant and mutable reference objects of their corresponding field types. This is very different from Google protocol buffer where simple value are returned from getters or passed as parameter to setters.

Here is an example for reading field values in mFAST.

```cpp
using namespace mfast;
void print_sample(const example::MDRefreshSample_cref& ref)
{
  cout << ref.get_BeginString().name() << " : " << ref.get_BeginString().c_str() << "\n";
  if (ref.get_ApplVerID().present())
     cout << ref.get_ApplVerID().name() << " : " << ref.get_ApplVerID().c_str() << "\n";
  cout << ref.get_MsgSeqNum().name() << " : " << ref.get_MsgSeqNum().value() << "\n";

  for (auto entry : ref.get_MDEntries()) {
     cout << entry.get_MDUpdateAction().name() << " : " << entry.get_MDUpdateAction().c_str();
   // ...
  }
}

example::MDRefreshSample message;

// message value is assigned somewhere else

print_sample(message.cref());
```

All mutable reference classes are derived from the const reference counterpart. In other words, int32_cref is the base class of int32_mref, seqence_cref is the base class of sequence_mref, etc. However, field_mref is not the base class of more specific mutable reference classes for fields such as int32_mref or sequence_mref; instead, those classes have an explicit type conversion constructor so that it's possible to static_cast from a field_mref object to a more specific mutable reference object. The following code demonstrates how to assign fields values.

```cpp
using namespace mfast;
example::MDRefreshSample message;
example::MDRefreshSample_mref ref = message.mref();
mref.set_ApplVerID().as("A");
assert(mref.get_ApplVerID().present());

mref.set_SenderCompID.as("B");
mref.set_MsgSeqNum().as(1);
auto entries = mref.set_MDEntries();
entries.resize(4);
entries[0].set_MDUpdateAction(1);
// ...

// using omit_xxx() to make optional field absent after assigning value
mref.omit_ApplVerID();
assert(!mref.get_ApplVerID().present());
assert(mref.get_ApplVerID().size() == 0);

// clear() can also make optional field absent
mref.set_ApplVerID("A");
assert(mref.get_ApplVerID().present());
mref.set_ApplVerID().clear();
assert(!mref.get_ApplVerID().present());
assert(mref.get_ApplVerID().size() == 0);


// However, clear() make the size to 0 for
// mandatory vectors, strings and sequences.

assert(mref.set_SenderCompID.present());
assert(mref.set_SenderCompID.size() == 1);

mref.set_SenderCompID.clear(); // becomes zero length string
assert(mref.set_SenderCompID.present());
assert(mref.set_SenderCompID.size() == 0);
```

Notice that mFAST reference objects are like C/C++ build-in pointers in that no logic is involved to track the lifetime of the field/value they refer to; i.e. no reference counting is employed. Once a top level value holder object is destroyed, all the references stem from that value holder object become dangling references. Therefore, it is very important that a reference object cannot be used when its value holder object is destroyed. However, it is possible to create a new value holder object from an existing constant reference object, i.e. object cloning, so that the new value holder has a different lifetime than the object from which it was cloned.

Reference objects are small and inexpensive to copy: a constant reference object contains only 2 pointers internally while a mutable reference object contains 3 pointers. Because no reference counting is involved, copying a reference object does not impede efficiency by damaging cache performance and creating pipeline bubbles.





# Decoding/Encoding FAST Messages
FAST encoding rules require both the encoder and decoder to agree on a set of templates which can be used for the encoded stream. In mFAST, we use a templates_description object to package all the meta information on the set of templates needed by FAST encoder/decoder. For each FAST template XML file, fast_type_gen would generated a templates_description a free function named description(), which returns a pointer to a templates_description object, nested inside its own namespace. Before we can use the encoder/decoder, we must initialize it an array of pointer to templates_description objects. Here is an example how to initialize the mFAST decoder.

c
const mfast::templates_description* descriptions[] = {
example::description()  // generated from fast_type_gen
};

mfast::fast_decoder decoder;

// In current implementation, decoder.include() can only be called
// exactly once per decoder/encoder
decoder.include(descriptions);
```

In certain case, it might not be possible to decide the set of templates to use at compile time. mFAST also provides an alternative approach to generate the templates_description object at runtime with a string of FAST XML templates.

```h
const char* xml_content = "<templates xmlns=\"http://www.fixprotocol.org/ns/template-definition\" ... </templates>";
mfast::dynamic_templates_description description(xml_content);
const mfast::templates_description* descriptions[] = {
&description
};
mfast::fast_decoder decoder;
decoder.include(descriptions);
```

After the decoder is properly initialized, we can decode a buffer as follows:

```h
const char* first = buf;
const char* last = buf + buf_len;

try {
  whille (first != last) {
    mfast::message_cref msg = decoder.decode(first, last);
    // Caveat 1: the variable *first* would be updated to the start of next unread position after decode().
    // Caveat 2: msg is only valid before next decoder.decode() is called or decoder object is destroyed.

    if (msg.id() == MarketData::the_id)
    {
        MarketData_cref sample = static_cast<MarketData_cref>(msg);
        print_sample(sample);
    }
  }
}
catch (boost::exception& ex) {
  // error handling
}
```

Similarly, encoding an application type into a vector<char> is as follows:

```h
mfast::fast_encoder encoder;
encoder.include(descriptions);
std::vector<char> buffer;
buffer.reserve(1024);

example::MDRefreshSample message;
// ...  write fields into message

encoder.encode(message.cref(), buffer);
```




# Memory Management
To maximize runtime efficiency, mFAST has an mfast::allocator abstract class for customizing the memory allocation strategy. The constructors of fast_encoder, fast_decoder and all generated types derived from mfast::message_type take a pointer to mfast::allocator as an optional parameter. If the parameter is not supplied, the system would use a global allocator implemented in malloc(), realloc() and free(). If the parameter is supplied, caution must be taken that the allocator out-live the objects using the allocator.

Suppose you implemented an allocator class called memory_pool_alloactor, the following demonstrates the incorrect and correct usage of allocators in mFAST.

```h
mfast::message_cref get_message1(const char* buf, size_t sz)
{
  memory_pool_alloactor alloc;
  mfast::fast_decoder decoder(&alloc);
  decoder.include(descriptions);
  return decoder.decode(buf, buf+sz); // WRONG, the returned message_cref out-lives the decoder and alloc objects which it stems from.
}

memory_pool_alloactor msg_alloc;
message_type msg(&msg_alloc);

void get_message2(const char* buf, size_t sz)
{
  memory_pool_alloactor alloc;
  mfast::fast_decoder decoder(&alloc);
  decoder.include(descriptions);
  mfast::message_cref ref=decoder.decode(buf, buf+sz);
  msg = mfast::message_type(ref, &msg_alloc); // OK, copy construct a temporary message_type object
                                              // and then move it to msg. mFAST uses boost::move to
                                              // simulate rvalue reference in C++03.
}
```




# mFAST Visitor
Although it is generally much easier to access application types using the getters/setters functions, as we have introduced, this might not be best way in certain situation such as logging the received messages in a human readable format. Using the getters to write a message logger requires prior knowledge of the application types and the logger functions may differ based on the application types. This kind of code tends to be unmanageable as the number of application types grows.

mFAST provides a better way to cope with the above scenario using the visitor pattern. The visitor pattern allows the separation of an object structure and the operations which operate on it without modifying the structure itself. To be more specific, in the context mFAST, you write a visitor class which has a set of overloaded visit() member functions. Each visit() member function takes an argument of concrete mFAST field reference types such as int32_cref, ascii_string_cref and sequence_cref, etc. You then create an instance of the visitor class at runtime and invoke the accept() member function of message_cref or message_mref with the parameter of the visitor object. Next, the visit() member functions will be called in the sequence of the fields contained in the message object.

There are two categories of the visitor class in mFAST: accessor and mutator. An accessor visitor is used to read the fields in a message object; therefore, the visit() member functions in the accessor visitor class only take constant reference objects as their arguments. Conversely, a mutator visitor is used to modify the fields in a message object so the visit() member functions in the mutator visitor class only take mutable reference objects as their arguments. The follow example shows how to print an arbitrary mFAST message object without the knowledge of the fields in the message.

```h
using namespace mfast;

// a generic message accessor
struct message_printer
{
  std::ostream& os_;
  indenter indent_;

  enum {
    visit_absent = 0 // indicating absent fields should not be visited
  };

  message_printer(std::ostream& os)
  : os_(os)
  {
  }

  template <typename PrimitiveTypes>
  void visit(const PrimitiveTypes& ref) const
  { // for int_cref<T>, decimal_cref, string_cref<T>, byte_vector_cref
    // and int_vector_cref<T>
      std::cout << indent_ << ref.name() << ":" << ref << "\n";
  }

  template <typename CompositeTypeRef>
  void visit(const CompositeTypeRef& ref, int) const
  { // for group_cref, sequence_cref, nested_cref

    os_ << indent_ << ref.name() << ":\n";
    ++indent_;
    ref.accept_accessor(*this);
    --indent_;
  }

  void visit(const sequence_element_cref&  ref, int index) const
  {
    os_ << indent_ <<  "[" << index << "]:\n";
    ++indent_;
    ref.accept_accessor(*this);
    --indent_;
  }
};

std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& os, const mfast::message_cref& ref)
{
  message_printer printer(os);
  ref.accept_accessor(printer);
  return os;
}
```


A few things must be noted for the above example.

A constant value visit_absent must be defined in a visitor class to indicate whether the absent fields should be visitor (0) or not (1).
If you are familiar with the visitor pattern, you might be puzzled why the visit class does not use inheritance and virtual functions. In fact, we do use inheritance and virtual functions internally. We just wrap it so that a user can write generic visitor() functions to combine several visit() member functions into one.
The visit() function for primitive types always take exactly one argument and those for non-primitive types always take int as second argument. This int argument is used for differentiation purposes only except for that for sequence_element_cref. In this case, the second argument is the zero based index of the passed-in element in the parent sequence object.
In the visit() member functions for non-primitive type, the line ref.accept_accessor(*this); (or ref.accept_mutator(*this); for mutator visitor classes) should be called; otherwise, the fields nested inside the group, sequence or templateRef won't be processed.





# Conclusion
In this article, we introduced the newly designed framework for serializing application data using FAST encoding rule. The approaches employed in the implementation of mFAST allowed a slimmer and far more efficient encoder and decoder. With the use of design patterns, it is also easier to develop applications with mFAST.

However, mFAST at the current stage is not a complete replacement for QuickFAST. First of all, mFAST APIs are entirely different from QuickFAST. This makes it difficult to migrate existing applications from QuickFAST to mFAST. Second, QuickFAST has built-in modules for session management while mFAST is purely for data serialization. Therefore, if session management is essential, QuickFAST does provide that capability.

We are very excited about the development of mFAST so far and believe it has potential to emerge from purely streaming FAST protocol to a more general serialization purpose for different formats. With the built-in reflective type system and visitor pattern support in its core, it is relatively easy to develop new encoding/decoding formats (such as FIX, JSON, Google Protocol Buffer) non-intrusively. For example, we already have a JSON encoder with only 140 lines of source code.

Currently, mFAST supports FAST specification version 1.1 only. Version 1.2 support is still under development.
